### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexey Plekhanov. I'm a software engineer with over 20 years of application development experience. For the past ten years, I have been designing, coding, and publishing iOS apps on the App Store.

Since 2016, I have founded and run [a small company](https://rapport.tech/) focusing on a B2B solution that helps everybody in the meeting room be on the same page.

The decade of professional experience gave me vast exposure to all Apple platforms including watchOS, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and also backend development using Server Side Swift.

I'm open to new opportunities where I can continue to learn, contribute meaningfully, and foster growth. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:mail@aplekhanov.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aplekhanov/)!
